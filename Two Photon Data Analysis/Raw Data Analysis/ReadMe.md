The codes take in the input of raw two photon data files.
All the files of different conditions in the same field are combined and motion corrected.
The cell contours are manually drawn on the average of all the motion corrected images.
The two photon signals will be plotted and saved along with excel sheet with activity details.

Toolboxes: These toolboxes are necessary to run these codes - 
NeuroSeg-master and
NoRMCorre-master

Data Structure:
A folder with raw 2P data files from same field can be selected as input.
The same folder name will be created in Processed data with plots and excel sheet saved.
